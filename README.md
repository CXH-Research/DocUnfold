## 🔮 Dataset

The HW5K dataset is available at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lkljty/HW5K).

# ⚙️ Usage

## Training

You may download the dataset first, and then specify TRAIN_DIR, VAL_DIR and SAVE_DIR in the section TRAINING in `config.yml`.

For single GPU training:

```bash
python train.py
```

For multiple GPUs training:

```bash
accelerate config
accelerate launch train.py
```

If you have difficulties with the usage of `accelerate`, please refer to [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate).

## Inference

```bash
python infer.py
```
